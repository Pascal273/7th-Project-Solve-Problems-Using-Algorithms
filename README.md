# Introduction
This is the 7th project for the Python path of Openclassrooms.
The goal is to design two algorithms that will maximize clients profits 
after two years of investment:

- Bruteforce version
- Optimized version

The algorithms must suggest a list of the most profit-yielding shares we should buy
while it complies with the following limitations:

 - Each share can only be bought once.
 - We cannot buy a fraction of a share.
 - We can spend at most 500 euros per client.


# Required Setup to run the program:

1. Python version 3.9.5 or higher must be installed.
   
# How to run the program:
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the main.py
3. Run the command: `python main.py`

   
## Notes
- The program will create folders and files automatically

## Technologies
- Python version 3.9.5
